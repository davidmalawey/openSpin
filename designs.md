## Design Needs
_let's begin a list of needs for bearing variations_

> 1) slip ring
> We need bearings that can transmit electrical power & signals - the concept is to have electrical conductors lining some region of the bearing such that continuity passes from a fixed member to a rotating mated member.
> Perhaps the simplest starting point is to have a metal film (such as nickel strip) [see Amazon](https://amzn.to/3O3jWk5) inserted before the metal balls, contacting the balls & having a tab passing to the outside or the inside of a race.

## Designs Ready

_key design variants can be broken down here by intended use cases_
