## Bearing Basics
Tutorials are coming soon!  If you wish to learn right away please explore the feature tree in my SOLIDWORKS model - then also review the "equations" inside of the design file.  The feature tree can teach you each step of making the model, and the equations table shows each key parameter which drives the geometry.

## Joining Polymers
One big reason for printing a custom bearing is to unite the part with polymer tubes such as PVC pipe.  In the end, the pipe can become part of your bearing and we can borrow assets such as resistance to high pressures, the cylindricity of the pipe, or the very long length.  Please check back soon for tutorials.
